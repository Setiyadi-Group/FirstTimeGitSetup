# FirstTimeGitSetup
You should have to do these things only once on any given computer; theyâ€™ll stick around between upgrades.

## Step by steps
1. Download Git and VSCode from their original websites, or you can use <a href="https://ninite.com">ninite.com</a>

2. Then after installing both of the app, set up your ```git config``` like this below and paste it on your cmd terminal, or you can visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">git-scm.com</a> for more details about the docs.

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

3. Create a new account or log in into an existing account on <a href="https://github.com/new">Github</a>, then start building your own reposiories on it.

4. Open VSCode and press "Mark Done", why? Because you can explore it later by yourself. Once it's done, let's clone your existing repository that you have just created.

5. After that, you will be redirected and asked for sign in into Github. While cloning you will be asked where the cloned repossitory will be stored. For that, you can create a new folder and asssign it. Don't forget to trust the author since you are the one who made the repository.

6. Now you can easily make a documentation about your work ```in ANY FIELDS, NOT JUST AN IT PERSON```, because this is the proof of your legacy that can be useful to be inherited by the younger generations.

7. Last step, stage all changes commit and push. I hope after this short tutorial, you can experiment yourself and gain wider understanding about how a piece of paper can lead humanity enjoy this kind of modern technology we use today.
